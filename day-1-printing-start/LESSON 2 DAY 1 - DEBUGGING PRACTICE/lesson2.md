**Instructions**
Look at the code in the code editor on the left. There are errors on all 4 lines of code. Fix the code so that it runs without errors.

Example Output
```python
Day 1 - String Manipulation
String Concatenation is done with the "+"" sign.
e.g. print("Hello " + "world")
New lines can be created with a backslash and n.
```

# Fix the code below ðŸ‘‡

```python
print(Day 1 - String Manipulation")
print("String Concatenation is done with the "+" sign.")
  print('e.g. print("Hello " + "world")')
print(("New lines can be created with a backslash and n.")
```
